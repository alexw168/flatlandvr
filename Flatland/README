Flatland is a virtual environment for the development of scientific and
information visualizations.  It uses a dynamic application loading scheme to
allow all aspects of the VE to be loaded and unloaded at will.  

Some base and example applications can be found in the ./modules directory.
User written modules should be put in the ./usr_modules directory.  
Utilities and function collections that are used by other modules, but do not
themselves produce objects should be placed in the ./services directory.

Installation

Short version: Unpack the base code and (optionally) unpack the user modules
into the Flatland directory created by unpacking the base code.  Then

  autoconf
  ./configure
  make
  make serv
  make modules_all

Alternatively, all of this can be accomplished with the command

  make all


Long version:  Same as above, with a few notes.

Flatland requires autoconf version 2.13.  Specifically, autoconf version 2.50
or higher will not work.  This is due to a bug in th 2.50 series of autoconf.
You can find out the version you are using with the command
"autoconf --version".

The make utility used for Flatland must be compatible with GNU make.  On some
systems (noteably SGI IRIX) the default make utility is not GNU.  Often the
GNU utilities can be accessed by using "gmake" in place of "make".

If the same distribution tree is used on multiple platforms, or even on
identical platforms that are configured differently, the "config.cache" file
will have to be erased and ./configure run again before the make will succeed.
If the results of the system command "uname" is different than the last time
the make was run, the make will automatically take care of the reconfigure.  

The Simple Direct-media Layer (SDL) libraries are optional for Flatland.  They
are used to drive some external socket programs, such as the sound server.  If
this isn't installed in one of the default places (/usr/local/lib, /usr/lib,
etc.) the exact location may have to be specfied.  This is done with
command line options to ./configure:

  --with-SDL-library[=PATH]
  --with-SDL-includes[=PATH]

This will force ./configure to look for the SDL libraries and includes in the
specified places.

Likewise, the glut library and includes can be specified using

  --with-glut-library[=PATH]
  --with-glut-includes[=PATH]

Keep in mind that the glut includes path should *not* include the final "GL".
So, for instance, if the glut.h path were "/usr/local/lib/GL/glut.h" then the 
./configure parameter for it would be "--with-glut-includes=/usr/local/lib".
